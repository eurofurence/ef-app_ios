See your favorites, bid on whatever you like, and buy art for your home!\r\n\r\nA separate registration is needed for bidding to get bid stickers.\r\n\r\nYou will have a final chance at bidding in the Art Show closing. Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art - or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction. \r\nImportant: The closing is a fast and decisive event. You need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the voice auction, you will have to defend your selection against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euros, and paid cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here.

Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event.

							"Description": "It's the 80s! Everything is bright and colorful! ... or is it? This year, one of the major TV networks is going to host an all new gameshow which will get the highest ratings yet! It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage",

This year, one of the major TV networks is going to host an all new gameshow which will get the highest ratings yet! It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage",

Defying massive persecution by man, foxes manage to prosper in the most diverse habitats all across the globe, from the lofty heights of Tibet to the crowded centers of European cities.\r\n\r\nStill, people tend to know surprisingly little about foxes, and deep-rooted prejudice against them is quite common. Hunters regard foxes as competing predators to be shot on sight. Other people consider them fur coats-to-be, transmitters of dangerous diseases, or predators of livestock. However, few people know that they are caring parents, affectionate lovers and playful tricksters who have an important role to play in the balance of nature. \r\n\r\nFauho and Shadowfox will give you an informative yet entertaining tour through the realm of the red fox, featuring pictures, video clips and a wealth of facts along with anecdotes from his rich personal experience with our four-legged vulpine brethren. \r\n",

This year, one of the major TV networks is going to host an all new gameshow which will get the highest ratings yet! It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage",

							"Description": "Welcome to the Anthropomorphic Wellness and First-Aid Center.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fursuiter at Eurofurence, no matter if you're a DANGER-MOUSE, an AIRWOLF, or a NINJA-TURTLE, you are definitely in for a lot of interesting encounters in our FULL HOUSE.  Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.",

							"Description": "Welcome to the Anthropomorphic Wellness and First-Aid Center.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fursuiter at Eurofurence, no matter if you're a DANGER-MOUSE, an AIRWOLF, or a NINJA-TURTLE, you are definitely in for a lot of interesting encounters in our FULL HOUSE.  Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.",

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.",

While we will have a short look at how to sew, the main focus of this panel is the creation of the pattern for the plushie.\r\n\r\nWe will have a look at a special method of pattern generation which relies on the creation of a digital 3D model. Using digital tools has the advantage, that you can try out different designs and - like in digital drawing - you can just undo mistakes. Don't let the words \"digital 3D model\" scare you - you need neither experience in 3D modeling nor sewing to make use of what you will learn in this panel.\r\n\r\nAfter this panel you will know everything you need to get started making plushies.",

							"Description": "Welcome to the Anthropomorphic Wellness and First-Aid Center.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fursuiter at Eurofurence, no matter if you're a DANGER-MOUSE, an AIRWOLF, or a NINJA-TURTLE, you are definitely in for a lot of interesting encounters in our FULL HOUSE.  Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.",

They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event.

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP&CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar. Don't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit-Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off. As if MACGYVER and and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n  - Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n  - Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n  - The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n  - Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n  - Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n  - Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Main-Lounge**\\\\\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This Lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\n** The Mini-Lounge**\\\\\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini-Lounge in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n**Opening times:** Main Lounge: daily from 9am til 2am or until after the last event. - Mini Lounge: Open 'round the clock",

							"Text": "Before the wolves asked me to tell their story (they needed me because they can’t type very well; their paws are too big and they keep hitting the space key when they don’t mean to) I was an acquiring editor signing books for people who work in nonprofit organizations. Before that, I was an actor in New York. I never got paid for acting, but my training has influenced me in many ways.\r\n\r\nI’m also a martial artist. I spent 8 years studying taekwondo and have a first degree blackbelt. For the past eight years, I’ve been studying White Crane Silat (Peratuan Gerak Badan) an Indonesian form of kung fu influenced by Shaolin. Martial arts influences my writing in many ways, in particular by teaching me to persevere in the face of frustration and to see writing as a practice.\r\n\r\nI’ve always loved dogs, and wondered why we have such a remarkable relationship with them. We treat them as our family and they treat us as pack. I was fascinated with the question of how that came to be. I’m also very interested in human evolution, in particular by unexplained things, like how we became the dominant species on the planet.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing about wolves when I began writing The Wolf Chronicles. In fact, I thought, as many people do, that wolves were vicious and would attack humans. Then I started my research and found out that not only did wolves not attack humans, they had very complex social structures that are very similar to human social structures. I also learned about the theory of wolf-human coevolution, the idea that wolves, and later dogs influenced our evolution and we theirs, and that they may have helped make us the dominant species on the planet. That’s when The Wolf Chronicles really began to take shape. It became about our relationship with the wild and about how the demonization of the wolf is the demonization of our own wild nature and connection to nature.",

							"Text": "The trilogy tells the story of how the wolf became the dog from the point of view of a young shewolf living 14,000 years ago in what is now Southern Europe. It is also the story of humans’ connection to the natural world and how, if we continue to treat wolves and other parts of nature as “other” rather than “self” we will destroy the environment we depend upon to survive.\r\n\r\nThe story is told by Kaala, a wolf of mixed blood born into the Swift River pack in the Wide Valley. Kaala struggles to be accepted into her pack, and as soon as she makes progress, she saves the life of a human child, breaking one of the most important wolf laws—to stay away from the humans. Risking expulsion from their pack and banishment from the Wide Valley, Kaala and her young packmates begin to hunt with the humans and thus discover the long-hidden bond between the two clans. But when war between wolves and humans threatens, Kaala learns the lies behind the wolf’s promise. Lies that force her to choose between safety for herself and her friends and the survival of her pack—and perhaps of all wolf- and humankind.",

							"Text": "Eurofurence proudly presents our charity for 2016: The Painted Dog Conservation. Fighting to save the last of an endangered species, it is not only a worthy charity, but also one that desperately needs all the help we can give it.\r\n\r\nYou may already know the African wild dog, also known as the painted dog (Lycaon pictus). These beautiful hunting dogs (which are actually not dogs at all, but a completely different species) have splotched fur patterns and big round ears. What most people do not know is that the painted dog is sadly also one of the most endangered species of Africa, with fewer dogs left on the whole continent than there are furries at Anthrocon!\r\n\r\nSadly, myths and misunderstandings have given them a bad reputation, causing them to be persecuted by humans. Many more are killed on the road, get caught in snares set by poachers to get bushmeat, or catch diseases from domestic dogs. Their numbers have dwindled from 500.000 to less than 7000 over the past century.\r\n\r\nThe Painted Dog Conservation is devoted to the protection of the wild dogs and is active in Zimbabwe, where the local population of dogs is one of the last strongholds of the species. Their conservation methods help both the dogs and the local human population in a lasting way, making the future outlook of the species brighter.\r\n\r\nThough the Painted Dog Conservation's work is very successful, there are sadly still many setbacks. As recent as last November, elephant poachers have put cyanide in the wildlife's drinking water, killing an entire pack of 9 dogs and their 11 pups. The painted dog needs our help now more than ever!",

							"Text": "As in past years, we are seeking donations of artwork and other unique items to be used in raising money for charity through our Lottery Booth, Charity Auction and an expanded Charity display in the Art Show with items for silent bidding. \r\n\r\nWe will still happily accept extra donations during the convention (see the con book for details).\r\n\r\nYou can also consider donating a percentage of your Art Show sales to charity (see more information during the online art submission process).\r\n\r\nThere will be various events, activities and other opportunities to donate money during the convention to support our charity. Like last year, we will host a special charity art auction where you have the chance to bid on unique items donated by attendees (all sales go 100% to charity). And like the previous years we will have a lottery booth in the lobby. There will also be fursuiters collecting with our official sticker. And other little fund-raising happenings will pop up here and there when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nIn addition, representatives of the Painted Dog Conservation will be available for you at a booth in the lobby, where you can ask questions, buy items, and learn more about the dogs or maybe become a 'Friend of the Painted Dog'. And finally, by popular demand we have decided to repeat the charity concert! Look at the schedule to find out when it is. Tickets for it can be bought at the lottery booth.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please direct them to the members of our charity team.",
