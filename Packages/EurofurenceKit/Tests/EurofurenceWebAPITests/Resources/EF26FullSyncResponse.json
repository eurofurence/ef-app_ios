You do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you already checked in at the Eurofurence Registration Desk before visiting the Fursuit Badge Desk during our service hours.\r\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, our desk can be found just outside the room with the Registration Desk, in the entrance area to the Rotunda.\r\nFor the rest of the con, we'll be in Estrel Hall B, right next to Registration.\r\n\r\nSince there have been cases in the past of people trying to get fursuit badges just to gain access to the fursuit lounge, we will have to ask you to bring the head of your fursuits along when you come to pick up your fursuit badges so we can compare them to the pictures on the badge.\r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered a fursuit badge, your first badge is free and you can use the fast lane for pickup. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal fursuit badge on site. For this service and all extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per badge.\r\n\r\n### Service hours for pickup and printing\r\n\r\n#### Entrance Rotunda\r\n\r\n**Tuesday:** from when the Eurofurence Registration Desk opens – 19:00.

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal fursuit badge on site. For this service and all extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per badge.\r\n\r\n### Service hours for pickup and printing\r\n\r\n#### Entrance Rotunda\r\n\r\n**Tuesday:** from when the Eurofurence Registration Desk opens – 19:00.

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

Here it will be determined who will make the final offer on a piece of art – or whether, perhaps, a contested piece goes to auction.\r\n\r\nImportant: the closing is a fast and decisive event. You will need to have bid stickers at hand to participate, so we can avoid crowding the show area with spectators. Bid stickers will only be available until 30 minutes before the closing. During the closing, we will not hand out new stickers, so make sure you have enough to place your final bids.\r\n\r\nIn the Art & Charity Auction, you will have to defend your selection of contested pieces against other prospective buyers. Please note that this year's auction starts earlier than in previous years.\r\n\r\nBids must be placed in Euro and paid in cash on site.\r\n\r\nLook out for more information at the Art Show and read the bulletin boards for last-minute details!",

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

The goal is to give everyone attending an idea about the diversity of playstyles and possibilities when doing ponyplay and to get everyone warmed up a bit. \r\n\r\nAfter that you will have the opportunity to try out different things yourself like pony dressage or trying out some pony gear you've always have been curious about. There will hopefully be plenty of time and opportunity for that. I'm not sure yet if I will be able to provide for cart pulling as well, due to the venue having less space available, but we'll try to make it available if we can.\r\n\r\nConsider the whole atmosphere to be very open, friendly and casual.\r\n\r\nPlease don't dress up without prior approval – only the panelists will have the opportunity to do so.

It's mostly used as a changing room, but also to take a short rest, rehydrate, dry/clean/brush fursuits, or simply have a chat with fellow fursuiters.\r\n\r\nPlease check the conbook for the rules!",

        "Description": "Time to wash the (sea's?) salty water off your face? Come and disembark at the\r\nFursuit Lounge and freshen up a bit!\r\n\r\nLike every year, we've set up a safe haven for fursuiters (and their stewards)\r\nto stretch their sea legs, where they can cool down, drink something other\r\nthan grog, and have a quick chat with the people they might not have seen in a\r\nwhile… probably because they were out on raids along the coast again. Haven't\r\nbeen there before, or want to know what's changed? Let us talk you\r\nthrough what you can expect!\r\n\r\n### Locations ###\r\n\r\nSince some of our regulars were a bit too rowdy and lit half the nearby town\r\non fire in a drunken stupor a while ago, we've sadly had to relocate slightly\r\nfurther down the coast. While you will still find the small treasure stash,\r\nthe mini lounge, at the same location in the lobby (more on this later), you\r\nwill now find our main lounge further north in the **ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**!\r\n\r\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the\r\ncheckerboard pattern** (\"The Rotunda\"), and **go down**. We suggest taking the\r\nstaircase on port side (left). Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and\r\n**keep going straight until you reach the far wall** and, with it, your\r\ndestination! Please ignore any sirens that might try to lure you off course.\r\n\r\nAs always, in case you have any trouble finding your destination, simply\r\nfollow your nose…\r\n\r\n### Services ###\r\n\r\nWhile the past few years of being in hiding (not to mention the relocation… or\r\nthe reparations for that raided village…) have forced us to take a step back,\r\nwe will still do our usual best to tend to your every wish! Below you can find\r\na short summary of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n#### Blowers And Dryers ####\r\n\r\nBreezes aplenty! Please take a seat or a stand in front of our blowers to cool\r\noff. If it's crowded, please keep some distance and share the\r\nbreeze. Likewise, please don't jump in front of people already using them from\r\nslightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The\r\nlong tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer\r\nsticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying\r\nbodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited\r\nand demand is high. Otherwise we might need to move your things for you!\r\n\r\n#### Drinks And Snacks ####\r\n\r\nFeel free to try several of our brews! (Sorry, but local laws prohibit\r\nalcohol, so no rum.) Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans\r\nafter, ok? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave\r\nwith more energy than you entered with!\r\n\r\n#### Helpers ####\r\n\r\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it's getting in or\r\nout of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves),\r\nor answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we'll do our best to\r\nget you what you need!\r\n\r\n### Rules ###\r\n\r\nTo avoid getting in trouble with the locals (again…), we're afraid we need to\r\nbe a bit strict about a few things. Always a few privateers ruining it for\r\neveryone else, am I right? Here goes:\r\n\r\n- **Fursuiters Only**\r\n\r\n  You are allowed to take 1 assistant with you, but please make sure that our\r\n  bouncers can see you are together. If you want to get into the lounge while\r\n  not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuit badge** (not your\r\n  con badge!) to enter. **Please don't forget to bring it, and do not leave it\r\n  inside!**\r\n\r\n- **No Glass Is Allowed In The Fursuit Lounge**\r\n\r\n  People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\r\n  Please drink your rum elsewhere. Eye glasses, monocles and spyglasses are\r\n  obviously excluded.\r\n\r\n- **No Blocking Of The Backs Of Fans**\r\n\r\n  We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head\r\n  cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way\r\n  is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n- **No Photo Or Video Recording**\r\n\r\n  People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their\r\n  salt-crusted faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No\r\n  exceptions.\r\n\r\nPlease don't argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple\r\nrules. If you ignore any of these rules, we might be required to move your\r\nthings for you, and we will not be responsible for you finding them again.\r\n\r\n### Mini Lounge ###\r\n\r\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers\r\nand water), in case you're afraid you won't reach the big fursuit lounge\r\nbefore you run aground. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel\r\nlobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you're free to use what\r\nis available to you there. The same rules apply, though!",

Participants at the panel will have an opportunity to try on a motion capture suit, gloves, and face capture system, and pilot one of our characters (wear tight fitting clothes or UnderArmor, the suits are tight!). During this panel, we will tell the story of our queer artists co-op, and aim to inform an audience of 3d hobbyists, technical artists, and animators about the successes we’ve had and the failures we’ve learned from since 2019 as we’ve developed our craft. We’ll include plenty of time for Q&A and lab exercises to demonstrate how motion capture works with anthropomorphic characters. Topics include use of software tools like Houdini, Unreal Engine, and TouchOSC, motion capture hardware from Rokoko, and what we’ve learned from OptiTrack and Vicon about their optical solutions. We’ll also talk about virtual production and the HTC Vive.",

I would like to present there very basic things about linear\r\nperspective itself and basic operations in it (dividing, scaling, multiplying), show\r\nrelations between character, objects and the background and how put them together to make\r\nan appealing picture, where everything fits to its own scale and size (which simply\r\nrequires setting/drawing a reference object/character/fixed length to compare all drawn\r\nthings to them).  Then i'd like to present how to draw basic sceneries in perspective\r\nusing all mentioned earlier knowledge like a simple street with buildings, a simple\r\ninterior with furniture of any kind and how to draw a background when a character is already drawn there. I might also present, how to draw sceneries\r\nwith multiple visible levels like inside of shopping mall or a scene seen from the top of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n",

Let's try building\r\nsomething useful and help connecting photographers and Fursuiters after events!\r\nSpecifically: identifying and tagging Fursuiters in event media galleries! In a\r\nfirst step, we attempted feeding an open source image segmentation model with a\r\nsmall dataset of Fursuiter pictures. We will present the methods and software\r\nused, show our evaluation results, and exchange ideas for a potential sustainable\r\npublic community cloud service.\r\n\r\n2) Games, VR, GCI movies: Digitalization allows us to visualize characters and\r\nworlds in ways previous generations could not imagine.\r\nYet the creation of high-quality digital assets ? especially animating digital\r\ncharacters in a realistic and convincing manner ? requires equipment and budgets\r\nthat private consumers can hardly afford.\r\nWe will take a look at how state of the art computer vision technology and\r\nrobotics can assist in bringing digital characters to life using commodity\r\nhardware and open source software.\r\nVideo-to-avatar motion transfer for custom animation sets for your sonas or\r\nfavorite characters, animated GIFS and Telegram stickers - just our two cents on\r\nwhat to do with this.",

Over the course of just six months, our team of specialized designers, artists, writers, and programmers create a design based on the next con’s theme. The theme is reflected in all matters of the website: even function follows design. An artist is on board to create a visual art piece to first introduce the new theme to both public and staff. The team then updates and layouts all content, molding everything into code that follows the newest standards and will run on all combinations of screens, devices, operating systems and configurations possible. The website team ensures the EF website is accessible to all and breathes the spirit of the theme!\n\nOnce the website is done, we don’t exactly sit back and relax. Throughout the year we provide updates to the website as they come in, ensuring any and all information is always up to date.\n\nOf course, we’re only human, so should we have missed anything or if you’re having any trouble accessing the website, feel free to drop us a note via web@eurofurence.org and we’ll get back to you!",

Behind the scenes, this requires a lot of planning, preparation, coordination and general \"making the magic work\". Thus there's barely a spot where IT systems don't play a role in the background. While, traditionally, each department builds and operates their own system tailored to their specific needs, more structure and knowledge has become vital over the years.\n\nThe Eurofurence IT department fills this role of a central coordinator and service team for every department that needs IT services before, during or after EF. Among those are the operation of the EF server, which hosts our website including the Daily EF archives, forums, a multitude of internal systems like wiki, etherpad, kanboard, otrs and so on. We help to coordinate the main registration system for EF, for fursuit badges, art show and dealers den. New systems are installed or custom-crafted for special purposes, like an electronic \"stage rider\" for stage events.\n\nOn-site we coordinate with the Estrel IT to get the internet connectivity working; for instance, this included last year's live-stream of our \"big party\" to the outside, running the IT infrastructure like DHCP/DNS, provide hardware (PCs, scanners, switches, etc.) for departments which don't have their own and run our staff wifi.\n\nThe most visible part for attendees is our very own \"Eurofurence app\". It's completely custom-built by us, with a high-performance cloud backend and native on iOS, Android and even Windows Phone. Close cooperation between departments is needed here to get all information from event programming, dealers enlistings, general information and more into the app.\n\nSince our work is so specialized and diverse, we don't usually have open job postings. However, if you're good at IT maintenance, administration and especially programming and would like to help primarily outside the actual convention days, feel free to contact Zefiro. You might soon become part of a ninja team dedicated to keep things running. \n\nIf you want to be a part of the IT team, contact Zefiro via mail or Telegram.",

Dozens of species face extinction across the world, and many more are increasingly vulnerable and threatened.\n\nThe Cheetah Preservation Foundation (CPF) was founded in 1988, with the principal aim of ensuring the survival of the cheetah and other endangered species, as well as educating our visitors. Their mission: To promote and fund the conservation of cheetah and other endangered species through captive breeding, research and public awareness.\n\nFor 34 years the CPF has worked tirelessly for the conservation of these animals – they are one of the 5 biggest cheetah centres in the world and have for many years had the highest survival rate of cubs produced globally.\n\n### Cango Wildlife Ranch\n\nThe Cheetah Preservation Foundation is a division of Cango Wildlife Ranch. CWR is one of the few facilities in South Africa to be accredited by PAAZA (Pan-African Association of Zoos and Aquaria) and WAZA (World Association of Zoos and Aquaria), showing their high standards of animal care and husbandry as well as their contributions to conservation.\n\n### Dedicated work\n\nThe Cheetah Preservation Foundation (CPF) has crafted a unique program where their visitors have the opportunity to meet some of their ambassador animals. \"It is our strong belief that when a person has a close educational experience with an animal, it instils a desire to protect the species and encourages a movement to be more mindful about the exploitation of their environment\".\n\nThe conservation and education facility doesn't receive government funding, which is an enormous challenge with the overheads that they face. In addition to their mission, their primary focus is to ensure that all their animals receive the highest attainable standards of medical care and premium species specific diets. Their standards are exceptionally high and it all comes at a cost, as do the many hours of labour put in by our over 100 dedicated and animal loving staff.\n\n### How our donations help\n\nEspecially during the pandemic, the CPF had a very hard time, lacking visitors and donations. All money we raise will make a huge difference for them and will be used for their various projects:\n\nExpanding enclosures, feeding the animals and caring for them, veterinary costs, cold storage rooms (important), providing food for over 200 animals, donations to conservation programs and education.\n\nYou can also get a sponsorship for a certain animal – for more information and options, please ask our Charity: Carmen Ellis and Craig Gouws from the CPF will be present at the convention. You can meet them at the charity booth or attend one of their panels to learn more about the endangered beautiful big cats.",

This is also valid for all vehicles registered in foreign countries, like cars, trucks, and busses, as well as for business travellers and for tourists. For this reason, it is recommended that all drivers inform themselves about the environmental badges, and purchase their badge on time. For further information, please contact the hotel or refer to the link below.\n\nThe hotel itself is just outside the green zone and can be accessed without an environmental badge. This however will prohibit you from entering the inner city, so take that into consideration when thinking about shopping and parking!",

Most conventions only are doing \"fursuit games\", which is fun but usually only mildly entertaining to watch. We strive to add some interesting aspects to all games that we are putting on stage. The best ideas however sometimes fail in reality, even after trying them out several times. The show is a \"one-off\" kind of a deal, so we always expect some \"issues\" which require fast troubleshooting capabilities.\n\nWe are usually looking for helpers in the backstage area: moving props on and off stage, getting fursuiters ready for their cue and sometimes helping during a game - as spotters and/or \"living props\", depending on the game.\n\nWe are planning everything out way before the convention and need helpers who will be available online at least some weeks before EF so we can go through the show and games and everybody knows the props, games and can start to learn their cues. We don't get rehearsal time at EF!\n\nIf you are interested in helping out, please contact: Atkelar via fsgs@eurofurence.org.",

Our responsibilities are directly connected with the convention attendees and involve post-processing of the images we take after EF is over. Thus - by definition - pictures that are needed during the convention are not part of our responsibilities.\n\nOur department consists of photographers and assistants.\n\nThe photographers:\n\n* Share some hours per day on the photo shoot location, using rented equipment.\n* Take turns covering various events for the media catalogue using their own camera (i.e. a halfway decent DSLR with RAW images is a must-have)\n\nThe assistants:\n\n* Help some hours per day on the photo shoot location. This involves handling props, fursuiters and/or operating the registration system computer on location. There will be two assistants in parallel.\n* If needed, help the photographers at other locations by holding up props, directing people or carrying equipment.\n\nBoth duties involve keeping to a schedule that will be discussed and up for fine tuning within the team as soon as the EF timetable is available, so usually nobody has to miss out on \"must go\" events.\n\nThe fursuit photo shoot might be amongst the more stressful tasks that EF has to offer, but the chance to meet lots of suiters up close and personal makes for a good reward. Also, we try to minimize the hours per day by using enough people to divide the workload.\n\nIf you are interested in helping out, contact Atkelar or ShortyDragon, using photo@eurofurence.org before the convention.\n\nThere are a few prerequisites for helping:\n\nWe might need a few helping hands during setup and tear down of the photo shoot location and the group photo spot that are able to carry some delicate equipment when directed to do so.\n\nFor actual team members...\n\n...the photographers need to:\n\n  * Have some studio experience (preferably also with fursuiters as subjects)\n  * Have experience with fursuiters (either as spotters or themselves)\n  * Be good at coming up with some funny ideas for poses\n  * Be on time\n\n...the assistants need to:\n\n  * Have experience with fursuiters (either as spotters or themselves)\n  * Preferably be good at coming up with some funny ideas for poses to help the photographer and suiter in case of a block\n  * Be on time",

        "Title": "Press & Media Relations",
        "Text": "**A little introduction**\n\nThe media industry is changing fast. Digital technology has dramatically reshaped the news and media industries in the past decade. The growth of social networks, the introduction of smartphones and the evolution of online advertising, have contributed to a brand new media landscape that is changing more and more every day. The internet has not only changed the methods and purpose of journalism, but also people's perceptions of news media. Firstly, the rise of bloggers and user-based journalism has become immensely popular among both new and old media companies, a change that has drastically altered the definition of a journalist. Secondly, the linked nature of the internet has given rise to content collectors like Google news or The Huffington Post that no longer rely on individual journalists to provide news, but instead depend on their ability to gather and collect information into a single place where users can access it. Together they are changing society's traditional ideas regarding journalists and news.\n\n\n**What about us?**\n\nA lot of people at conventions don't want to talk to the press. But we can't just shut our doors. So that's where our team comes in. As a press and media relations volunteer for EF you represent the work of a huge convention, acting as a contact point for members of the press and other media representatives. We want to provide journalists with accurate information and give them a realistic look at our community. The press isn't good or bad; it's just the press. We just have to make sure they get right picture and the right story. \nWhen you are part of the media relations team it is important to remember that you represent a whole community. This means that we got a lot of responsibilities. You need to be prepared for the fact that anything you say to a journalist could end up in print or on a website the following day. \nThe job requires you to be flexible, friendly and patient. Sometimes there's nothing to do, sometimes all journalists arrive at the same time. The job can be stressful so you must be able to work under pressure. The cool thing about working at press relations is that you are also able to show your side of the story. You can influence how the convention looks to the outside world. Also you're part of a great team full of passionate people. \n\n**Skills**\n\nPress and media relations team members are:\n\n  * Flexible\n  * Patient\n  * Enthusiastic\n  * Friendly and approachable\n\nJob requirements:\n\n  * Communication skills\n  * Knows how to deal with criticism\n  * The ability to work under pressure\n  * Passion for our community\n  * Speaking and understanding the German and English language\n\nIf you want to help us, then come to the press & media reception at the convention or write an email to media@eurofurence.org.\n\n\n**FAQ: How to cooperate with journalists?**\n\n*How much time do journalists have?*  \nJournalists are busy people. They are not here for fun, they are working. They have one goal in mind and that is to write a good story. \n\n*How should I greet the journalists?*  \nFirst impression is everything. Greet them, talk to them and make them feel welcome. Even if you don't like journalists you should always treat them with respect. They're human beings just like you and me. \n\n*Are there rules the journalist must follow?*  \nYes! Before you show a journalist around make sure they are well informed about what they can and what they can't do. They should always first register at the media desk. Here they can get a media badge and the necessary information.\n\n*What if they say something that is not true?*  \nDon't get angry. Even if they ask difficult questions, you should stay positive. It can be really frustrating when reporters give you the feeling they don't take you seriously, or if their information is inaccurate. But getting angry only makes it worse. \n\n*But what story should I tell them?*  \nKeep it simple. Most of the time journalists are not interested in all the details you want to tell. Stick to a straight and simple story. There is also a press-release featuring all kinds of background information which journalists can read in their own time if they're interested. \n\n*Any tips for when they ask me questions?*  \nMake it personal. When you are guiding a journalist they will ask you a lot of questions. Some of them may be difficult to answer. If this happens and you don't know what to answer just make it personal. Tell your own version of how you see things.  \nBe polite! Even if they aren't. The best advice is to help journalists as much as possible by giving them (where reasonable) what they ask for. Ensure that your information is relevant to them and provides a good read!\n\n*But what if they ask me difficult questions?*  \nAgain, just stick to your original plan and keep it to yourself. Don't argue with them because it often makes things worse because most of the time you accidentialy confirm stories you don't want to confirm. In the worst scenario you can always just ignore the question.  \nBear in mind, journalists are good at making out they have the entire story already.",

The Art Show presents exhibits by all manner of artists and facilitates the sales between participating artists, agents and attendees interested in purchasing a piece.\n\nHowever, the Art Show Team does far more than meets the eye: Apart from the regular opening hours of the exhibition, there are setup hours where the panels and tables are prepared, preparation hours where the artists or agents hang their exhibits, accounting hours where the Art Show team enters bids in the database, selling hours where buyers can pick up purchased art, and naturally the famous Stage Auction.\n\nAnd all of this is just done at the con itself - in addition, before the convention we register artists, distribute panels, build new panel hardware, and care for the technical equipment and applications involved in the Show.\n\nThe Art Show handles much of the Charity services too: Charity is partaking in the Auction, has its own panels and tables at the Art Show, and makes use of Art Show database and sales service to get its exhibits processed.\n\n---\n\nBesides having two Directors to run various aspects of the Show, we employ a small dedicated team of core staffers. The two directors share responsibilities before and during the convention; from the application process through database maintenance and logistics. Each individual team member has their own field of expertise; manning the front desk, handling sales, performing photography, or entering data at the auction.\n\nTo alleviate the huge amount of work which comes with the task of processing over a thousand exhibits, we rely on the help of dedicated volunteers and temporary staff. Much of the work concentrates on certain times: setup, accounting, auction, and sales are the critical crunch times, while the actual opening times do not present a special challenge to the team.\n\nCovering these rush hour work times is only possible by dynamically adapting the team. The runners during the sales are, for example, guest volunteers. Other helpers are borrowed from other departments. But beyond temporary helpers, we are also seeking to expand the permanent core team to meet the coming challenges of a still-growing Art Show, and we're welcoming applicants.\n\n---\n\nWhat we all share is a dedication for the creative roots of our fandom in both two dimensional picture from and three dimensional sculpt or show piece. We also have some deep rooted connections to our fellow creators who wish to share and show off their pride pieces to the public. Many of us have a background in the arts ourselves, and some of us have remained contributing artists to the community we serve. Thus we can fully empathise with the needs and necessities of both artist and their agents or our clients wanting to buy the piece they have grown to be fond of.\n\nWorking at the Art Show is quite rewarding, as it is a service within the creative heart of the furry idea. Supporting our own talented artists and being able to supply original furry works is what sets our fandom apart from franchise-based fandoms, and we are providing this service with pride.\n\n---\n\nSkills desired to become an Art Show team member:\n\n  * Enthusiastic about the arts and craft of our fandom.\n  * Speaking English; knowledge of German highly recommended as much of the team is German-speaking. (Other languages (French, Russian...) are helpful but not a must.)\n  * Able to work concentratedly and cautiously with often fragile exhibits. Willing to learn the Art Show application that is the core of our accounting system. No programming skills needed but welcome if present.\n\nIf you want to be a part of the Art Show Team, then contact: Cairyn via artshow@eurofurence.org or speak to the staff guys in the Art Show during the convention.",

        "Title": "Security Service",
        "Text": "Calling ourselves the \"Eurofurence Security Crew\", we as a Department of about 95 furries, not few of them professionals in fields like EMS (Emergency Medical Service), the Fire Department or the Police, see the safety and enjoyment of all convention attendees as our ultimate goal. While being responsible as well for security relevant aspects during the Convention preparation, as for security operations during the running Convention, most of you will normally not see or hear much of us, unless it becomes really necessary.\n\nPrior to a Convention, or rather in between two of them, several administrative tasks in preparation fall into our business. These tasks vary from authoring a legal safety concept together with the Eurofurence Paramedic Crew and local safety authorities to advising and supporting other Department directors in regards to fire and safety regulations. During the convention our Security and Paramedic Crew ensures health and safety of all our attendees, while silently enforcing the rules. Those rules are not limited to the RoC (Rules of Conduct) but include venue policies, fire safety, legal regulations, laws and many more. Furthermore we setup and run checkpoints on key areas such as the Art Show or the Campfire.\n\nIn all of our work, we strive to hold up our fundamental rules:\n\n  * We treat everyone with respect and never forget that we ourselves are members of the furry community\n  * We abide by the law and we do not raise ourselves above others\n  * We condemn intolerance and treat everyone equal\n  * We understand our duty to be a service to all attendees\n  * We set the safety and enjoyment of everyone involved with our convention as our highest goal\n  * We believe in a defensive and emphatic approach to any problem\n  * We strive to always stay fair and unbiased\n\nThe Security Crew is led by the Eurofurence Security Directors Treyfane Dingo, KittehBit, Venture, FireDawgAT and Kazookie. Together they form the Security Board and are responsible for the organization in advance and hold the final OnSite authority in security matters. Especially qualified Group Leaders manage dedicated Security Groups for their assigned CheckPoints such as the Art Show.\n\nThe tactical management on site is carried out 24/7 by a dispatcher, a shift supervisor and an on-duty member of the Security Board. Dispatch also ensures a permanent and direct point of contact for all staff, the hotel and (via dedicated phone lines or exclusive Eurofurence call boxes) all attendees. Check-in of (dangerous) items and the Ove Night Fursuit Locker Service is handled by the shift supervisor in the OnSite security office. Incident coordination is also the responsibility of the dispatcher, which they carry out following a clear catalog of procedures and an internal alert and response order. The dispatcher is the information and communication backbone for the entire Security Crew.\n\nMembers of the Security Crew are selected for reliability, distinctive social skills, calm demeanour and experience gathered at previous conventions. Their application requirements are the strictest but in return the crew has great team spirit. Ensuring the quality of security service in an environment as dynamic and demanding as a furry convention requires extensive communication skills. The Security Crew is currently able to communicate in more than twelve different languages without external personnel.\n\nSecurity support can be requested from the dispatcher by any Staff Member, telephone (+49 3222 2133812), through any of our CallBoxes (found in various areas of the hotel) or in person in the security office at all times during the convention. Of course female officers are available as well as private meeting rooms for confidential talks.\n\nIn case of any questions before or during the convention, the Security Board will gladly be there to support you. If any advice or assistance regarding security or safety for an event or panel is needed, feel free to contact the Security Board at security@eurofurence.org.\n\nWe are constantly open for applications for new Security Crew Members! If you want to contribute in the biggest Team at Eurofurence, feel free to contact us at security_hr@eurofurence.org.",

A lot of material and equipment must be in the right place long before even the first guest arrives at the hotel. During the convention, our guests can interact with ConOps personally through the Locker-Service (managed by the security team in the previous years) for storage of valuable luggage or the front office which will be at your service for any requests or problems you might encounter. Behind the scenes, we still manage several tasks. We prepare events and panels, setup and breakdown of equipment, transport and acquire additional materials and much more. After the convention is officially over we are still hard at work. After deconstruction and evaluation, we start planning for the next Eurofurence and react on general requests of attendees throughout the whole year. So, with us you will gain an exceptionally sight behind the scenes and structures of Eurofurence.\n\nWe are involved nearly everywhere and help wherever we can.\n\n**What's our motivation?**\n\nOur motivation is sourced in our excitement in helping others. We enable and relieve others. Our will to help each other is the base of our doings and our passion for EF drives us forwards.\n\n**Contact**\n\nIf you have any additional questions feel free to contact Darkwing or CintasFox in the ConOps-Office or via operations@eurofurence.org.\n\n**We are looking for:**\n\nAt the moment, we are looking for additional hands in the following departments:\n\n  * Setup and breakdown: This team needs to be available before and after the official part of the convention and it is responsible for the transportation of our equipment. New members would need to arrive earlier and/or departure later. If you have any experience in logistics it would be appreciated but it's not mandatory. It is quite possible that you would need to spend a significant amount of time on this task but only before or after the official part of the convention.\n  * On-demand crew: This crew is a quick response team for unforeseen additional tasks during the convention. Additionally, to your will on helping us you would only need the Telegram app on your phone. The time you will spend on these tasks is limited to the tasks you respond to. If you can't respond to every request that's no problem.\n  * Room management: This team prepares panel rooms following the event schedule. Different equipment has to be transported to or fetched from the panel rooms. You need to be reliable and on time to prevent any delays in the schedules. Therefor you will work with others in time slot separated schedules. During the convention days, this will take 1-2 hours of your time every day.\n  * Front office: In the front office you have to respond to questions or inquiries of our guests. Therefor you will need to speak English quite fluently. Also, you need to be calm, professional and friendly all the time. The front office team is organized by a schedule that is divided in 2h time slots. You will spend approximately 2 hours a day in the office when you join us, limited to the main con days of course.\n  * Locker-Service: The Locker Service allows our guests to leave their luggage in our hands and we will take good care of it. We are currently transferring this service from the security team to con ops, and are therefore looking to expand our staff to cover our new responsibility. You have to handle these bags, trunks, cameras or cases with great care and reliable. It would be appreciated if you will be able to speak to your customers in English and additional languages. The locker Service is available during its opening hours and during these you will need to spend approximately 1-2 hours a day of your time.\n\nIf you want to join several teams please contact us and we will do our best to find a solution that suits your expectations.",

With an after con meeting at the last day we try to improve our work every year. During stage team meetings throughout the year we come up with new ideas and concepts that fit the theme of the upcoming EF. Exchanging knowledge and ideas is vital for this. Assigning tasks and making time schedules is also done during stage meetings.\n\nOperator, Programmer, Event Manager, Stage Manager and Backstage Manager are some of the roles that need to be staffed for every event. You don't need to have knowledge about stage work to be a part of the stage team, as long as you are eager to learn and get excited about event technology. You do? – Then you are a good fit to work with us.\n\nMost of the stage equipment is supplied by a professional rental company, which we work together with for several years.\n\nThe Main Stage is setup by the rental company. As soon as the setup is finished, our work starts. Programming of light-, laser- and sound-consoles is done by senior team members who are specialized in their departments or work as event technicians. They are assisted and operated by those who want to gather deeper knowledge in the particular field of work.\n\nAt Eurofurence, we host a wide spectrum of stage events. From game-shows to concerts to dances and the well-known Pawpet-Show: Everything is made possible and assisted by the stages team. We connect the artists with technology so they can deliver the best performance possible.\n\nWe are working with professional sound, light and video equipment so here are some basic job requirements:\n\n  * Good self-assessment\n  * The ability to work under pressure\n  * Punctuality and reliability\n  * Speaking and understanding the German or English language\n\nSounds good?

Artists for example offer their services with sketches, con badges, little drawings or full coloured artwork, they sell high quality prints, self published comic books and all kind of little things with their art and handwriting on in. Some artists specialized on sewing and costume building offer pre-made costume parts, self made plushies and display their portfolio for commissions later on. Dealers and merchants offer a wide variety of either self made or designed goods like t-shirts, leather crafting, soaps, sweet treats and liqueur, or offer books and plushies from lager brands. The Dealers' Den team itself runs the Eurofurence Shop on site which offers all the leftovers earlier Eurofurences, mostly t-shirts. \n\nThe Dealers' Den also maintains the Artist Alley - a point of sale in the public area where mainly artists have the opportunity to sit down and offer their skills in a more flexible way. Since there is no registration needed the Alley is meant to be an area where artists and customers get together spontaneously - first come, first serve. \n\nThe Dealers' Den Team makes sure that everything from preparations and registration for the Den, the seating situation, to the point of sales itself (including set up and break down of tables and power sockets) works out smoothly for the artists, dealers and customers. We are also the contact persons for the artists and dealers during the convention to all kind of departments like Con Ops and Security if there might be any problems need to be solved. We also host all kind of minor services like a PC with scanner or a get together party for artists, dealers and staff members together with the Art Show Team. \n\n---\n\nAt the moment the Dealers' Den team is not looking for help, but times are changing, especially at the convention, so don't hesitate to ask if they need help. \n\nThe required time depends on the job you have within the team - most of the work has to be done in advance, like registration forms, seating plans, e-mails, artwork for the conbook and door signs, handouts etc. On site it is about two hours of set up on Wednesday and three for the cleaning on Sunday, or additional Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 11:00 to 19:00 within the Den in the Eurofurence Shop. \n\nIf you want to be a part of the Dealers' Den team, then contact: Pattarchus via dealers@eurofurence.org.",

Water carriers and fan service will be available!\n\nThe precise number of suiters in the picture will be announced after the convention, when we had time to count!\n\n* **Location**: Convention Hall II\n* **Time**: Thursday, 16:30",

Further tasks are:\n\n  * Communication with artists (Art Work)\n  * Communication with other conventions (Advertising)\n  * Creating a design for the current years' Conbook fitting the theme\n  * Layout the content\n  * 3D-artist to update and adapt the hotel maps\n  * editorial work and proof reading\n\nMain motivation to be in the Conbook department are the lovely team members who are all very passionate about pretty design. Everyone knows the phrase \"No one ever reads the Conbook\"... now we have the vain idea to change a few people's minds by trying our best every year anew  \n\nWe are always looking for people who are either native to the English language (AE) or very fluent at it to help proofreading the Conbook.

Adding characters and storyline the show evolved into one of the larger stage events at Eurofurence.\n\n**About us**\n\nIn the beginning it was just a handful of people, today we are a group of more than 30 volunteers working together to create a story-based, drama/action/comedy filled show for mature audiences. Resembling a makers workshop we use our different skills to create puppets, backgrounds, props, special effects, music, script and so on to make this production become reality. Contrary to our beginnings, all of our puppets on stage nowadays are built by our puppet creators, making each of them unique. We share the passion for theatrical productions and some of our goals include a good storyline, convincing characters and situations that astonish the audience.\n\nIf you want to be a part of the Pawpetshow team, the contact: Cheetah via cheetah@tigress.com.",

        "Text": "Eurofurence likes to present itself as a professional convention of friendly, respectful and open-minded members of the furry community and their friends. As a condition of membership, all Eurofurence attendees are required to abide by these rules of conduct for the entire duration of their stay, even prior to opening or after closing of the convention. When in doubt about any of these rules, please don't be afraid to ask - we will gladly answer all your questions. However, please understand that we will not debate these rules with you during the convention. The rules of conduct are enforced by the Eurofurence Security Crew who will be clearly identified as such on site. If you have any problem with any action taken by a staff member you may take the matter up at the Security Office or with the Chairman.\n\n**General Rules**\n\nAny action or behavior that causes significant interference with convention operations, excessive discomfort to other attendees, or adversely affects Eurofurence's relationship with its guests, its venues or the public is strictly forbidden and may result in permanent suspension of membership. This general rule supersedes all others listed below and may be invoked at any time.\n\n* Please treat each other respectfully.\n* You are liable for any damage you might cause.\n* Always follow the directions by convention staff and Eurofurence Security Crew Members.\n* Harassment of any kind, including physical assault, battery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome physical attentions, will not be tolerated.\n\nPlease be aware that the atrium, the Beer Garden and the restaurants are public areas, and that there may be regular hotel guests around who are not taking part in our convention. Please help us give them the best possible impression of our fandom!\n\n**Registration and Badges**\n\nAttendees are required to have their badge on display in the hotel's public and convention exclusive areas at all times. Fursuiters are not required to wear their badge openly but must have it with them.\n\n* You must be at least 18 years old by the first day of the convention.\n* Eurofurence convention exclusive areas are open only to registered attendees.\n* Attendees are identified by their personal membership badge.\n* A badge is valid only for the person to whom it was issued and may not be shared.\n* Badges must be presented and / or surrendered to Security Crew Members upon request.\n* Changing or obscuring information on your badge is not allowed.\n* The lanyards issued with your badge must not be changed to one of a different color.\n\n**Hotel Rules**\n\n* The consumption of food or drink purchased from outside of the hotel is not permitted on the premises of the Estrel hotel, with the exception of your private room and around the campfire.\n* Smoking is not permitted inside the Estrel Hotel, the Convention Center and in the direct vicinity of the front entrances.\n* It is strictly forbidden to throw/dangle/hang anything out of any windows, balconies or any other elevated location.\n* Attendees may not enter the service areas of the hotel. This includes backstage areas, service elevators, rooftops, emergency exits and all areas marked as \"Staff Only\".\n* Disabling or deliberately triggering fire-protection devices (such as smoke detectors, sprinklers or door alarms) is strictly prohibited.\n* The sale of any kind of merchandise outside the official Dealers' Den requires explicit permission by the Eurofurence Board of Directors.\n* No sleeping in the lobby, the hallways or the meeting rooms. Get a room, please!\n* For safety reasons it is not allowed to bring dogs, cats or other animals into your hotel room or any of the convention event areas.\n\nGas cylinders or any other high pressure containers, regardless of content or size, are not permitted anywhere on the hotel premise without written authorization by the Eurofurence Security Service. This does not apply to deodorant / hair sprays or medication.\n\nOperating large electrical appliances in your private room, including any form of heating / cooling devices or industrial fans, is not allowed. Small fans to dry out costumes, regular (CE marked) chargers for smartphones, tablets or laptops are deemed okay but must not be operated without supervision. All other electrical appliances must be checked in and tested at the Security Office.\n\n* Personal music players such as bluetooth speakers or boom boxes may not be used in a way that may disturb any bystanders.\n\nPortable music players can be a fun addition to all kinds of social activities. However, music that is played too loud can be a serious nuisance, and it's easy to forget how far your sound may carry. Pretending to be a one man fursuit dance may be fun to you, but sitting in the middle of a cacophony of conflicting music styles can be very stressful for your environment. Please turn down your volume, switch off your device when there is already playing music in the area, and avoid walking around with your music still playing.\n\n**Parties and Gatherings**\n\nGatherings in hotel rooms must not generate any noise that can be heard in neighboring rooms during nighttime hours. Hotel room doors must be kept shut during such gatherings and guests are not permitted to congregate in the hotel corridors.\n\n* Parties that are deemed too loud will be given a single warning. Subsequent complaints will lead to the party being shut down and possibly further consequences for the individuals involved.\n* Eurofurence Security Service is required to clear out overcrowded rooms. For your own safety, we recommend keeping the occupancy below 10 in a regular room, or below 20 in a junior suite.\n\nAll room occupants are equally responsible for cleaning up after a party. Trash must be put into bags. Don't leave a mess for housekeeping. Do not leave empty bottles, glasses or other trash behind. Please clean up after yourself.\n\n**Clothing and Decency**\n\n* Wearing costumes, accessories or displaying items made out of real fur is not allowed.\n* When in public areas of the Estrel Hotel and Convention Center, attendees may not wear clothing or accessories which are overly revealing, inappropriate to the atmosphere of the convention, or likely to draw reasonable complaint or offense.\n* To prevent damage to costumes and hotel property, body paint requires an individual permission to be obtained at the Security Office. Face makeup does not require permission, but please be careful!\n* Public displays of affection beyond what is appropriate for polite company are non-desirable. Please express your devotion to your significant other either in less conspicuous ways, or in private.\n* Display of fetish gear is not permitted in public areas.\n* Display of adult materials (such as room signs, flyers, business cards, posters and drawings on public message boards) is not permitted in public areas.\n\nThe limit for \"adult themed\" materials is the equivalent of a German FSK16 rating. When in doubt, please contact us either by email before the convention (security@eurofurence.org) or ask at the Security Office during the convention.\n\nWhen used as part of a costume (fursuit), the following items are usually allowed:\n\n* Collars\n* Decorative Wristbands\n* Harnesses\n\nThe following items are explicitly not allowed in public:\n\n* Full-body rubber or vinyl gear\n* Costumes that are visibly \"anatomically correct\" or indecently revealing the wearers own private anatomy\n* Costumes or accessories related to age-play, pet-play or BDSM\n\n**Alcohol and other Substances**\n\nYou are expected to drink responsibly. You will be held accountable for what you do, under the influence or not. Persons who are intoxicated to the point of incapacity will be escorted to their room, and may consequentially be expelled from the convention.\n\n* Any individual found to be in possession of or distributing illegal or controlled substances will be expelled from the convention and reported to the local authorities.\n* The use of \"legal highs\" or the abuse of substances like glue, nitrous oxide (laughing gas), alkyl nitrites (poppers) and others is strictly prohibited.\n\n**Weapons**\n\nYou may not carry any weapons anywhere on the premises of the hotel or the convention center at any time. In this context, any object which is, according to its nature, suitable for inflicting injuries to persons or animals or to do damage to property will be considered a weapon. This includes items which are legal according to German weapon laws like i.e. Kubotans, pepper / cs spray, alarm guns (even with permit) and any other object deemed too dangerous by Eurofurence Security Service.\n\n* All weapon look-alikes, LARP props, replicas, tools and weapon like toys must be checked and approved in the Security Office immediately after your registration on site.\n* Eurofurence Security Service may require your weapon to be peace-bond. Tampering with the peace bonding will invalidate the clearance immediately.\n* Water pistols, silly string, or any thrown or projectile-type toy may not be used inside the Estrel Hotel or Convention Center.\n\nMock fights, swordplay, fire breathing or similarly dangerous activities are not allowed. Exceptions for staged events may be granted by Eurofurence Security Service. Please inquire ahead of time, preferably before the convention.\n\n**Hate Speech and Symbols**\n\nSpeech in any form that promotes or encourages discrimination, harassment, or violence based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, or nationality is strictly prohibited.\n\nYou are not allowed to wear, display or otherwise propagate symbols of forbidden organizations according to §86 and §86a of the German Penal Code (StGB) or symbols relating to groups associated with the \"alt furry\" movement.\n\nThe ban includes any sign or icon embodied in a physical object but also optical and acoustical symbols qualified to give an unbiased third party the impression of being a distinctive mark of any of the organizations mentioned above. It furthermore applies to variations or modifications similar enough to be mistaken for those symbols or intentionally obscured renderings of those symbols.\n\n**Photography and Video**\n\nEurofurence e.V. reserves all rights to video and photo material gathered at the convention with the exception of footage from private rooms. Eurofurence e.V. grants you the right to use videos and photos you have taken at the convention for private and/or non-commercial purposes.\n\n* Publication in for-profit media requires written permission by the Board of Directors.\n\nOfficial Eurofurence camera teams (identified by a \"Eurofurence Media\" badge) may record video and take photos in all areas of the convention and during events to be used for publication. You agree that videos and pictures taken of you can be used in such publications without release or compensation. A release will only be required for material filmed in situations where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.\n\n* Photography and filming is not allowed in the Art Show, the Fursuit Lounge and other \"headlesss fursuiter\" areas.\n* Further restrictions and rules may apply for certain events, as posted on location.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nMany of the above rules involve \"worst-case\" scenarios and are put into place to ensure the safety and comfort of our attendees. Since most of them are common sense, there is usually not much need to enforce them. However, we are prepared to deal with any or all of the above scenarios in a rapid and efficient manner, should they occur. We thank our attendees for their past cooperation and for their continued assistance in keeping Eurofurence a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nHave fun, be nice to each other, and we will all have a great time!",

        "Text": "**What is the FURSUIT SUPPORT TEAM?**\n\nIf you have ever been to a furry convention, you will have likely found yourself surrounded by cute fursuiters posing for photos and offering hugs. And while the furry fandom thrives on the wide range of creativity and different art forms; fursuiters are often the most prominent phenomenon on site. These giant fuzzy critters are bringing their anthropomorphic fantasies into the living world.\n\nFursuiting is a whole lot of fun. However, it is also an extremely warm and exhausting thing to do. Imagine, if you will, running around in a thick whole body winter coat in the middle of summer. Your vision is limited, your breathing is muffled and your sense of touch is greatly reduced. It's not the most pleasant situation to be in for a long period of time. This said, fursuiters brave these harsh conditions to bring smiles to people, entertain and have fun.\n\n**Here is where Fursuit Support comes in.**\n\nWe love to see these critters around as much as possible. And the better we take care of their needs and wellbeing, the more often we get to see them performing. The work we do is unseen by most attendees, but we are there when fursuiters hide from the public eye to break character to recover.\n\nWe get paid in hugs and thank yous from people who can fursuit twice as long now rather than dying of heatstroke or dehydration. Seeing that Eurofurence is praised for its fursuit friendly services and having one of the highest fursuiter quotas of all conventions fills us with great pride.\n\n**So what does the Fursuit Support team actually do?**\n\nBy far our biggest job at the convention is running the \"Fursuit Lounge\". A large hall filled with cooling blower arrays, self-constructed costume drying systems, a fursuit repair center, dozens of drink supply stations and lots of storage space. Once set up, we constantly have to keep all this clean, stocked, and looked after. We are, of course, always there to lend a helping hand, answer questions, check on people's health, and ensure a fursuiter's \"character-privacy\" is respected.\n\nWe also provide these services to panels and events. If a panel or dance involves fursuiters, then we ensure there are wind machines and a backstage area with water and snacks for them.\n\nFursuiters also get their own convention badges that need to be produced and handed out by a whole team of dedicated volunteers.\n\nMany of our tasks may seem menial, such as refilling water, cleaning areas, carrying things around etc. But even these small tasks can mean the world to an exhausted fursuiter who needs nothing more than some fresh air and water.\n\n**Would you like to help?**\n\nEvery year the Fursuit Lounge is among the first permanent service running and is usually the last to close down at the end of the convention. This is a lot of time to cover and a lot of suiters to keep happy. If you would like to join our team and help us keep our fursuiters suiting, here is what we are looking for in a volunteer:\n\n* You feel that assisting fursuiters and giving them a safe space is important,\n* You are willing to help for about an hour per volunteer shift, preferably more than once during the convention,\n* Ideally you are able to help with building up the Fursuit Lounge before, and breaking it down after, the convention,\n* You are capable of communicating in basic English,\n* You can handle heavy water kegs without breaking them or yourself, or know how to use a badge printer to help with the fursuit badges.\n* Last but not least, fursuiters need us the most when they are out having fun and exhausting themselves. We are at our busiest during these times and will need all the help we can get often late into the night to cover the fursuit dances.\n\n\n**Have questions or want to help?**\n\nWe would love to hear from you at fursuit-team@eurofurence.org !",

        "Text": "**Our Responsibilities**\n\nOur departments responsibilities include everything from the discussion of suitable guest of honor candidates to taking care of our guests at the convention itself. However most of our tasks have been taken care of month before the convention starts. After introducing Eurofurence to our potential guest, inviting them, and in best case, getting a positive response, rooms and flights need to be booked, events need to planed, information needs to be gathered – all this requires a lot of communication and cooperation with the other departments. In fact, we need to thank all the other departments a lot at this point. Their hard work and dedication makes our job even possible in the first place.  \n\n**Our Motivation**\n\nAfter the convention is before the convention. Being a staff member means for us that, when the mere endless wait for next year's Eurofurence starts and the PCD hits hard, there is still a bit of Eurofurence going on each week. Weather the regular group chats with the other departments, looking for fitting guests, writing invitations or planning ahead our guests events - it all elevates the mood and never feels like a chore. Having contact with all these creative, nice and amazing people throughout the process is something we would never want to miss. Another great motivation is to get a look behind the scenes. Seeing how the next Eurofurence takes shape, how much work, how many hours of planning and how much creativity is put into everything is a great experience. We are still taking so many things for granted, only to discover later the enormous amount of effort it took to make it run so smoothly. Another enormous motivator is the pride that derives from playing a small role in making the Eurofurence what it is. \n\nPlus, the greatest thing of all is, after greeting a guest arriving at the Estrel, days later at the departure we very often get to say goodbye to a new friend. \n\nIf you want to be a part of the Guest of Honor team, then contact: Arahn via r.burkhardt@weserbild.de.",

        "Title": "Fursuit Lounge",
        "Text": "**Like every year, EF has a dedicated Fursuit Lounge, intended for fursuiters only. It's mostly used as a changing room, but also to take a short rest, rehydrate, dry/clean/brush fursuits, or simply have a chat with fellow fursuiters.**\n\nSo, are you tired after a long fursuiting session? Come visit the Fursuit Lounge to cool down and refresh!\n\n###  Locations: ###\n\nWe actually have two locations; first is the mini lounge with limited resources for people who need a quick break and don’t want to walk all the way to the big lounge. You can find more info on this in the ‘Mini lounge’ section below. But if you want the real deal, come find the main Fursuit Lounge further north in the “**ECC ROOM (2 &) 3**”!\n\nFrom the Estrel hotel lobby, go north past the mini lounge, **past the checkerboard pattern** (“The Rotunda”), and **go down**. There is an elevator, but please only use this when necessary; we suggest taking the left staircase instead. Then go straight through the (mostly glass) wall and **keep going straight** until you reach the far wall, and with it, your destination! \n\n### Services: ###\n\nExact services vary slightly per year, depending on availability and what our team has come up with (we always try to find new ways to help!). Below you can find a short summary of what you can expect:\n\n#### Blowers and Dryers ####\n\nPlease take a seat or a stand in front of our fans to cool off. If it is crowded, please keep some distance and share the breeze. Likewise, please don’t jump in front of people already using them from slightly further away. For outfits, please (only) use the dryers instead! The long tables of pipes are for drying heads (short stubs) and handpaws (longer sticks), while the airborne pipes in wooden construction are for drying bodysuits. Try not to keep your stuff on there too long, as space is limited and demand is high. We might need to move your things for you otherwise!\n\n#### Drinks and Snacks ####\n\nWe always have lots of water, some flavoured, most cooled with ice, to keep you optimally hydrated. Feel free to grab some, for free! Please just make sure you deposit your cup in one of the trashcans afterwards? We also try to provide some sugary and salty snacks, so you can leave with more energy than you came!\n\n#### Helpers ####\n\nOur trusty staff is always happy to help you out! Whether it’s getting in or out of suit, grabbing a drink (we know it can be tricky with claws or hooves), or answering questions, please feel free to ask us and we’ll do our best to get you what you need!\n\n### Rules: ###\n\nWhile we hate to emphasise the negative, sadly we’re afraid we need to be a bit strict about a few things. Rest assured there’s a good reason for each and every one of these rules, so please don’t try to get creative to get around them so we have to make them even more detailed:\n\n* **Fursuiters only.**\n  * You are allowed to take 1 (non-fursuiter) assistant with you, but please make sure that our door stewards can see you are together.\n  * If you want to get into the lounge while not in suit, you will be asked to show your **fursuiter badge** (not your con badge!) to enter. Please don’t forget to bring it, and do not leave it inside!\n* **No glass is allowed in the fursuit lounge.**\n  * People come here to stretch their legs, not to cut them open on shards!\n  * Eye glasses (to see with) are obviously allowed.\n* **No blocking of the backs of fans.**\n  * We know this is a popular and effective way of drying your gloves and head cloths, but please consider that all sweat that is being extracted this way is now being blown straight into the faces of anyone sitting on the other side. And balaclavas getting sucked in can block the fans and do serious damage to the motors inside.\n* **No photo or video recording.**\n  * People come here to relax, not to be wary of anyone taking record of their half-clothed bodies and sweaty faces. If you want to take pictures, go elsewhere. No exceptions.\n\nPlease don’t argue with our staff if they ask you to follow these simple rules. If you ignore any of these rules, *we might be required to move your things for you*, and *we will not be responsible for you finding them back*.\n\n### Mini lounge: ###\n\nAs always, there is a small lounge with some basic services (mostly blowers and water), in case you are afraid you will not reach the big fursuit lounge. You can find it between the Rotunda and the hotel lobby. We may not always be there to assist you, but you’re free to use what is available to you here. The same rules apply, though!\n\n### Opening times ###\n\nThe main Fursuit Lounge will be locked at night. The Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day from **09:00** to **02:00** the next day, or whenever in the morning the last event of the day ends. The mini lounge will be accessible around the clock while the convention lasts.\n\nPlease be aware we can't promise we will be able to provide the full (or any) service on early arrival or dead-dog day. Especially while building up and breaking down we might be required to disallow bringing fursuits into the lounge, to prevent us from damaging your prized possessions as we are carrying around heavy materials. **On Sunday please remove all your costumes from the fursuit dryers by noon, as we are going to break everything down in the afternoon.**",

        "Text": "Programming at Eurofurence is primarily about putting together the convention schedule. What sounds easy at first gets more interesting and complex if you understand that it's about coordinating the departments of Eurofurence and attendee panels with their induvial timetables and requirements for resources and rooms.\n\nThat means over 500 hours of scheduled event time in up to 18 parallel events distributed over the whole convention space, and the numbers are growing! While planning this, it's important to take into account what kind of events are running in parallel and allow enough time before and after them. Keeping an eye on the available resources like sound systems and projectors or even people able to operate them add up to it.\n\nMost of our work is done the moment the con starts, but to guarantee a smooth con experience we work closely with Con-Ops and Security while the convention is running. On-site programming is keeping track of the schedule and re-schedules time or location if necessary. We try our best to keep the attendees informed of possible changes and delays by announcing these via our screens, twitter, telegram and the ef-app. To archive that we constantly check back with the other departments too. We also use these channels to pass news from our departments to our attendees. \n\nCommunication is a key. Not only internal, but primarily with interested parties outside. The job demands an organisational talent with an eye for details without losing track of the big picture. \n\nIf you want to be a part of the Programming team, then contact us via events@eurofurence.org.",

The Scottish artist going by the civil name of Ian James Armour has been a fixture on the fandom's nautical charts for multiple decades and, when not on stage or busy giving autographs and selling CDs in the Dealers' Den, is often found socialising with other attendees over a pint of a cold Irish dry stout.\n\nBeing a virtuoso on basically any instrument with keys, he has not only performed together with other musicians in the fandom, but also had his albums performed by renowned orchestras, most notably the English Chamber Orchestra (Come Find Me) and the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra (The Dreamcatcher), both of which were recorded at the famed Abbey Road Studios in London. Outside of his various appearances at furry conventions around the globe, Fox Amoore has performed at locations ranging from the Albert Hall and Liverpool's Cavern Club in the UK to Vancouver, Canada to Gold Coast in Australia. His genres are just as diverse as the sites he performs at, with a focus on New Age and Orchestral pieces based strongly on piano, but also including Jazz as well as some Electronica and Modern Dance tracks.\n\nYou can find Fox Amoore and his music online on Fur Affinity, Bandcamp, Twitter, SoundCloud, Facebook, DeviantArt and Patreon under his handle FoxAmoore as well as on YouTube as KeyboardFox or on his website: foxamoore.com\n",

        "Text": "## Eurofurence 26 - \"Welcome to Tortuga - On the High Seas\" - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Rules & Regulations\n\nAs per our Rules of Conduct (RoC) to ensure the safety of all attendees, **full vaccination to provide complete immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) at the time of the convention Eurofurence 26 - \"Welcome to Tortuga - On the High Seas\" is required.** We will ask for proof upon check in, you will only be able to check-in on site if you are considered to have complete immunisation according to section 22a (1) of the Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) (EMA-approved vaccines) at that time.\n\n**Attending the Convention in 2022 without complete immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is not possible.**\n\nComplete immunisation (until 30 September 2022) according to section 22a (1) of the Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) consists of:\n\n**Two vaccination** doses; or\n\n**One vaccination dose**, provided that\n\n* the person concerned can provide proof of a positive antibody test carried out prior to the vaccination, showing that they were infected with the coronavirus before receiving the vaccination; or\n* the person concerned can provide proof of a positive nucleic acid test (e.g., PCR test) carried out prior to the vaccination, showing that they were infected with the coronavirus before receiving the vaccination; or\n* the person concerned was infected with the coronavirus after the vaccination and can provide proof of a positive nucleic acid test (e.g., PCR test) carried out after receiving the vaccination and at least 28 days prior to travel.\n\nThe EU authorized vaccines as of today are:\n\n* Comirnaty (Pfizer / BioNTech)\n* Spikevax - COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna\n* COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)\n* Vaxzevria - COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca\n* Nuvaxovid\n\nPlease refer to the list of approved vaccines in the EU as stated in the links.\n\n## Proof of vaccination\n\nTo ensure the safety of all attendees, you must, at the time of your check-in on site, present proof of vaccination within the meaning of section 22a (1) of the Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) that meets the following requirements **in full**: \n\nIt must be an EU Digital COVID Certificate or comparable proof of vaccination in digital or paper form in German, English, French, Italian or Spanish. Photographs of documents in paper form will not be accepted as digital proof. Proof in digital form needs to have been issued electronically by the authorised issuer and transmitted electronically to the authorised holder. \n\n**Proof of vaccination must contain the following information:**\n\n* the personal details of the vaccinated person (at least their given name and family name and the date of birth or the number of the passport or other official photo ID to be presented upon inspection),\n* the date/s of vaccination and number of vaccination doses,\n* the name/s of the vaccine,\n* the name of the disease vaccinated against, and\n* distinctive features which show the identity of the person or institution responsible for administering the vaccination or issuing the certificate (e.g., an official logo or the name of the issuer).\n\nWe will accept your national equivalent (e.g., UK vaccination certificate, CDC card) if it meets the criteria described above. \n\nPlease check the links for additional information about the EU Digital COVID Certificate. \n\nPlease be aware that if you can obtain an EU Digital COVID Certificate we suggest getting one, since this will greatly speed up the check-in waiting time on site for you as all other documents have to be validated manually by our medical staff. The certificate must be technically valid (the technical validity of 365 days can be refreshed within the respective certificate apps) at the time of the check-in.\n\n## Mask mandate\n\n**All attendees are required** to wear a FFP2 / N95 / KN95 face mask (ISO EN 149-2001) or an \"OR\" type face masks (doctor's masks) (ISO EN 14683 Type II) or an uncertified fabric face masks (with or without prints) **in all areas that are marked with a mask mandate**.  The mask must cover mouth and nose. \n\nFursuiters are exempted from wearing a face mask while wearing their fursuit head. \n\n**We urge all attendees to always wear a face mask in all public convention areas.**\n\nIn the event of a deviating legal government regulation existing at the time of the event, which prescribes a general obligation to wear face masks or a specific type of face mask, the legal government regulation applies.\n\n## Test mandate\n\n**A general obligation for the attendees to present a negative PCR test / antigen test at the time of check-in on site does not apply.** All attendees are **required**, however, upon having symptoms indicating an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), to agree to antigen tests (lateral-flow tests), conducted at the discretion of the medical service of the convention. Failure to agree to such a test upon having symptoms will lead to the immediate expulsion of the attendee from the convention. \n\nIn the event of a deviating legal government regulation existing at the time of the event, which prescribes a general obligation for tests, the legal government regulation applies. \n\nPlease also check the travel regulations for travels to Germany which can deviate from the convention rules.

Sketch or Badge are at the same price of 50€ - sketch is ballpoint-pen, pencil or ink wash - badge is colored pencil & ink.\r\n\r\nI also sell pride merchandise as I am unapologetically queer and trans* - so if you fancy a pronoun badge, pride stickers or a mousepad, check out my wares.",

It’s much more a drama and a detective story than a romance.\r\nYou can read it for free on www.beingmonsters.com or on Webtoon.\r\n\r\nAt EF: \r\nI’ll bring my illustration series and books to the Dealer’s Den again (Junicorn, Tiny Inklings, Morph, etc.), and I'll have a few originals in the art show.
